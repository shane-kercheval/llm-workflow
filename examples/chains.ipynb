So a `Chain` is a simple mechanism that takes an input and sends the input to the first link, and the propegates the output of the first task to the second link, and so on, until the end of the chain is reached, and returns the final result.** \n",

This functionality allows the chain to contain convenient properties that aggregate the costs and usage across all links of the chain, and can also be used to explore intermediate steps and events in the chain."
