       "\n",

       "1. Add a docstring at the beginning of the function to describe its purpose, input parameters, and return value.\n",
       "2. Include comments throughout your code to explain complex logic or any important details.\n",
       "3. Use meaningful variable names to enhance code readability.\n",
       "4. If your function has any dependencies, mention them in the documentation and provide instructions on how to install or import them.\n",
       "\n",
