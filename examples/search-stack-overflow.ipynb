You hint the type of the object(s) you\\'re using</em>.</p>\\n<p>Due to the <em>dynamic</em> nature of Python, <em>inferring or checking the type</em> of an object being used is especially hard.

As a result they resort to trying to infer the type with (as mentioned in the presentation) around 50% success rate.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>To take two important slides from the type hinting presentation:</p>\\n<h3><em><strong>Why type hints?</strong></em></h3>\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Helps type checkers:</strong> By hinting at what type you want the object to be the type checker can easily detect if, for instance, you\\'re passing an object with a type that isn\\'t expected.</li>\\n<li><strong>Helps with documentation:</strong> A third person viewing your code will know what is expected where, ergo, how to use it without getting them <code>TypeErrors</code>.</li>\\n<li><strong>Helps IDEs develop more accurate and robust tools:</strong> Development Environments will be better suited at suggesting appropriate methods when know what type your object is.

It should be helpful when developing large projects as <em>it offers much needed robustness, control and additional debugging capabilities</em>.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<h2><strong>Type hinting with mypy</strong>:</h2>\\n<p>In order to make this answer more complete, I think a little demonstration would be suitable. I\\'ll be using <a href=\"http://mypy-lang.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>mypy</code></a>, the library which inspired Type Hints as they are presented in the PEP. This is mainly written for anybody bumping into this question and wondering where to begin.</p>\\n<p>Before I do that let me reiterate the following: <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PEP 484</a> doesn\\'t enforce anything; it is simply setting a direction for function\\nannotations and proposing guidelines for <strong>how</strong> type checking can/should be performed. You can annotate your functions and\\nhint as many things as you want; your scripts will still run regardless of the presence of annotations because Python itself doesn\\'t use them.</p>\\n<p>Anyways, as noted in the PEP, hinting types should generally take three forms:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Function annotations (<a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PEP 3107</a>).</li>\\n<li>Stub files for built-in/user modules.</li>\\n<li>Special <code> # type: type</code> comments that complement the first two forms. (See: <strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39971929/what-are-variable-annotations-in-python-3-6/39973133#39973133\">What are variable annotations?</a></strong> for a Python 3.6 update for <code># type: type</code> comments)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Additionally, you\\'ll want to use type hints in conjunction with the new <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>typing</code></a> module introduced in <code>Py3.5</code>. In it, many (additional) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)#Abstract_and_Concrete\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ABCs</a> (abstract base classes) are defined along with helper functions and decorators for use in static checking. Most ABCs in <code>collections.abc</code> are included, but in a <em>generic</em> form in order to allow subscription (by defining a <code>__getitem__()</code> method).</p>\\n<p>For anyone interested in a more in-depth explanation of these, the <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>mypy documentation</code></a> is written very nicely and has a lot of code samples demonstrating/describing the functionality of their checker; it is definitely worth a read.</p>\\n<h3>Function annotations and special comments:</h3>\\n<p>First, it\\'s interesting to observe some of the behavior we can get when using special comments. Special <code># type: type</code> comments\\ncan be added during variable assignments to indicate the type of an object if one cannot be directly inferred. Simple assignments are\\ngenerally easily inferred but others, like lists (with regard to their contents), cannot.</p>\\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If we want to use any derivative of <em>containers</em> and need to specify the contents for that container we <strong>must</strong> use the <em><strong>generic</strong></em> types from the <code>typing</code> module. <strong>These support indexing.</strong></p>\\n<pre><code># Generic List, supports indexing.\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\n# In this case, the type is easily inferred as type: int.\\ni = 0\\n\\n# Even though the type can be inferred as of type list\\n# there is no way to know the contents of this list.\\n# By using type: List[str] we indicate we want to use a list of strings.\\na = []  # type: List[str]\\n\\n# Appending an int to our list\\n# is statically not correct.\\na.append(i)\\n\\n# Appending a string is fine.\\na.append(&quot;i&quot;)\\n\\nprint(a)  # [0, \\'i\\']\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If we add these commands to a file and execute them with our interpreter, everything works just fine and <code>print(a)</code> just prints\\nthe contents of list <code>a</code>. The <code># type</code> comments have been discarded, <em>treated as plain comments which have no additional semantic meaning</em>.</p>\\n<p>By running this with <code>mypy</code>, on the other hand, we get the following response:</p>\\n<pre><code>(Python3)jimmi@jim: mypy typeHintsCode.py\\ntypesInline.py:14: error: Argument 1 to &quot;append&quot; of &quot;list&quot; has incompatible type &quot;int&quot;; expected &quot;str&quot;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Indicating that a list of <code>str</code> objects cannot contain an <code>int</code>, which, statically speaking, is sound. This can be fixed by either abiding to the type of <code>a</code> and only appending <code>str</code> objects or by changing the type of the contents of <code>a</code> to indicate that any value is acceptable (Intuitively performed with <code>List[Any]</code> after <code>Any</code> has been imported from <code>typing</code>).</p>\\n<p>Function annotations are added in the form <code>param_name : type</code> after each parameter in your function signature and a return type is specified using the <code>-&gt; type</code> notation before the ending function colon; all annotations are stored in the <code>__annotations__</code> attribute for that function in a handy dictionary form. Using a trivial example (which doesn\\'t require extra types from the <code>typing</code> module):</p>\\n<pre><code>def annotated(x: int, y: str) -&gt; bool:\\n    return x &lt; y\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The <code>annotated.__annotations__</code> attribute now has the following values:</p>\\n<pre><code>{\\'y\\': &lt;class \\'str\\'&gt;, \\'return\\': &lt;class \\'bool\\'&gt;, \\'x\\': &lt;class \\'int\\'&gt;}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If we\\'re a complete newbie, or we are familiar with Python\\xa02.7 concepts and are consequently unaware of the <code>TypeError</code> lurking in the comparison of <code>annotated</code>, we can perform another static check, catch the error and save us some trouble:</p>\\n<pre><code>(Python3)jimmi@jim: mypy typeHintsCode.py\\ntypeFunction.py: note: In function &quot;annotated&quot;:\\ntypeFunction.py:2: error: Unsupported operand types for &gt; (&quot;str&quot; and &quot;int&quot;)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Among other things, calling the function with invalid arguments will also get caught:</p>\\n<pre><code>annotated(20, 20)\\n\\n# mypy complains:\\ntypeHintsCode.py:4: error: Argument 2 to &quot;annotated&quot; has incompatible type &quot;int&quot;; expected &quot;str&quot;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>These can be extended to basically any use case and the errors caught extend further than basic calls and operations. The types you\\ncan check for are really flexible and I have merely given a small sneak peak of its potential. A look in the <code>typing</code> module, the\\nPEPs or the <code>mypy</code> documentation will give you a more comprehensive idea of the capabilities offered.</p>\\n<h3>Stub files:</h3>\\n<p>Stub files can be used in two different non mutually exclusive cases:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>You need to type check a module for which you do not want to directly alter the function signatures</li>\\n<li>You want to write modules and have type-checking but additionally want to separate annotations from content.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>What stub files (with an extension of <code>.pyi</code>) are is an annotated interface of the module you are making/want to use. They contain\\nthe signatures of the functions you want to type-check with the body of the functions discarded. To get a feel of this, given a set\\nof three random functions in a module named <code>randfunc.py</code>:</p>\\n<pre><code>def message(s):\\n    print(s)\\n\\ndef alterContents(myIterable):\\n    return [i for i in myIterable if i % 2 == 0]\\n\\ndef combine(messageFunc, itFunc):\\n    messageFunc(&quot;Printing the Iterable&quot;)\\n    a = alterContents(range(1, 20))\\n    return set(a)\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>We can create a stub file <code>randfunc.pyi</code>, in which we can place some restrictions if we wish to do so. The downside is that\\nsomebody viewing the source without the stub won\\'t really get that annotation assistance when trying to understand what is supposed\\nto be passed where.</p>\\n<p>Anyway, the structure of a stub file is pretty simplistic: Add all function definitions with empty bodies (<code>pass</code> filled) and\\nsupply the annotations based on your requirements. Here, let\\'s assume we only want to work with <code>int</code> types for our Containers.</p>\\n<pre><code># Stub for randfucn.py\\nfrom typing import Iterable, List, Set, Callable\\n\\ndef message(s: str) -&gt; None: pass\\n\\ndef alterContents(myIterable: Iterable[int])-&gt; List[int]: pass\\n\\ndef combine(\\n    messageFunc: Callable[[str], Any],\\n    itFunc: Callable[[Iterable[int]], List[int]]\\n)-&gt; Set[int]: pass\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>The <code>combine</code> function gives an indication of why you might want to use annotations in a different file, they some times clutter up\\nthe code and reduce readability (big no-no for Python). You could of course use type aliases but that sometime confuses more than it\\nhelps (so use them wisely).</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>This should get you familiarized with the basic concepts of type hints in Python. Even though the type checker used has been\\n<code>mypy</code> you should gradually start to see more of them pop-up, some internally in IDEs (<a href=\"http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2015/11/python-3-5-type-hinting-in-pycharm-5/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>PyCharm</strong></a>,) and others as standard Python modules.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ll try and add additional checkers/related packages in the following list when and if I find them (or if suggested).</p>\\n<p><em><strong>Checkers I know of</strong></em>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"http://mypy-lang.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Mypy</strong></a>: as described here.</li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/pytype\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>PyType</strong></a>: By Google, uses different notation from what I gather, probably worth a look.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em><strong>Related Packages/Projects</strong></em>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/python/typeshed/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>typeshed:</strong></a> Official Python repository housing an assortment of stub files for the standard library.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The <code>typeshed</code> project is actually one of the best places you can look to see how type hinting might be used in a project of your own. Let\\'s take as an example <a href=\"https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/stdlib/3/collections.pyi#L78\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the <code>__init__</code> dunders of the <code>Counter</code> class</a> in the corresponding <code>.pyi</code> file:</p>\\n<pre><code>class Counter(Dict[_T, int], Generic[_T]):\\n        @overload\\n        def __init__(self) -&gt; None: ...\\n        @overload\\n        def __init__(self, Mapping: Mapping[_T, int]) -&gt; None: ...\\n        @overload\\n        def __init__(self, iterable: Iterable[_T]) -&gt; None: ...\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/generics.html#defining-generic-classes\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Where <code>_T = TypeVar(\\'_T\\')</code> is used to define generic classes</a>. For the <code>Counter</code> class we can see that it can either take no arguments in its initializer, get a single <code>Mapping</code> from any type to an <code>int</code> <em>or</em> take an <code>Iterable</code> of any type.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><strong>Notice</strong>: One thing I forgot to mention was that the <code>typing</code> module has been introduced on a <em>provisional basis</em>. From <strong><a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0411/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PEP 411</a></strong>:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A provisional package may have its API modified prior to &quot;graduating&quot; into a &quot;stable&quot; state. On one hand, this state provides the package with the benefits of being formally part of the Python distribution. On the other hand, the core development team explicitly states that no promises are made with regards to the the stability of the package\\'s API, which may change for the next release. While it is considered an unlikely outcome, such packages may even be removed from the standard library without a deprecation period if the concerns regarding their API or maintenance prove well-founded.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>So take things here with a pinch of salt; I\\'m doubtful it will be removed  or altered in significant ways, but one can never know.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p><sup>**</sup> Another topic altogether, but valid in the scope of type-hints: <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-526-syntax-for-variable-annotations\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><code>PEP 526</code>: Syntax for Variable Annotations</a> is an effort to replace <code># type</code> comments by introducing new syntax which allows users to annotate the type of variables in simple <code>varname: type</code> statements.</p>\\n<p>See <em><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39971929/what-are-variable-annotations-in-python-3-6/39973133#39973133\">What are variable annotations?</a></em>, as previously mentioned, for a small introduction to these.</p>\\n', text='I would suggest reading  PEP 483  and  PEP 484  and watching  this presentation  by  Guido  on type hinting. \\n In a nutshell :  Type hinting is literally what the words mean.

You hint the type of the object(s) you\\'re using*.\\n\\n\\nDue to the *dynamic* nature of Python, *inferring or checking the type* of an object being used is especially hard. This fact makes it hard for developers to understand what exactly is going on in code they haven\\'t written and, most importantly, for type checking tools found in many IDEs ([PyCharm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyCharm) and [PyDev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyDev) come to mind) that are limited due to the fact that they don\\'t have any indicator of what type the objects are. As a result they resort to trying to infer the type with (as mentioned in the presentation) around 50% success rate.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nTo take two important slides from the type hinting presentation:\\n\\n\\n### ***Why type hints?***\\n\\n\\n1. **Helps type checkers:** By hinting at what type you want the object to be the type checker can easily detect if, for instance, you\\'re passing an object with a type that isn\\'t expected.\\n2. **Helps with documentation:** A third person viewing your code will know what is expected where, ergo, how to use it without getting them `TypeErrors`.\\n3. **Helps IDEs develop more accurate and robust tools:** Development Environments will be better suited at suggesting appropriate methods when know what type your object is. You have probably experienced this with some IDE at some point, hitting the `.` and having methods/attributes pop up which aren\\'t defined for an object.\\n\\n\\n### ***Why use static type checkers?***\\n\\n\\n* **Find bugs sooner**: This is self-evident, I believe.\\n* **The larger your project the more you need it**: Again, makes sense. Static languages offer a robustness and control that\\ndynamic languages lack. The bigger and more complex your application becomes the more control and predictability (from\\na behavioral aspect) you require.\\n* **Large teams are already running static analysis**: I\\'m guessing this verifies the first two points.\\n\\n\\n**As a closing note for this small introduction**: This is an **optional** feature and, from what I understand, it has been introduced in order to reap some of the benefits of static typing.\\n\\n\\nYou generally **do not** need to worry about it and **definitely** don\\'t need to use it (especially in cases where you use Python as an auxiliary scripting language). It should be helpful when developing large projects as *it offers much needed robustness, control and additional debugging capabilities*.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**Type hinting with mypy**:\\n---------------------------\\n\\n\\nIn order to make this answer more complete, I think a little demonstration would be suitable. I\\'ll be using [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org/), the library which inspired Type Hints as they are presented in the PEP. This is mainly written for anybody bumping into this question and wondering where to begin.\\n\\n\\nBefore I do that let me reiterate the following: [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) doesn\\'t enforce anything; it is simply setting a direction for function\\nannotations and proposing guidelines for **how** type checking can/should be performed. You can annotate your functions and\\nhint as many things as you want; your scripts will still run regardless of the presence of annotations because Python itself doesn\\'t use them.\\n\\n\\nAnyways, as noted in the PEP, hinting types should generally take three forms:\\n\\n\\n* Function annotations ([PEP 3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/)).\\n* Stub files for built-in/user modules.\\n* Special  `# type: type` comments that complement the first two forms. (See: **[What are variable annotations?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39971929/what-are-variable-annotations-in-python-3-6/39973133#39973133)** for a Python 3.6 update for `# type: type` comments)\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, you\\'ll want to use type hints in conjunction with the new [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module introduced in `Py3.5`. In it, many (additional) [ABCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)#Abstract_and_Concrete) (abstract base classes) are defined along with helper functions and decorators for use in static checking. Most ABCs in `collections.abc` are included, but in a *generic* form in order to allow subscription (by defining a `__getitem__()` method).\\n\\n\\nFor anyone interested in a more in-depth explanation of these, the [`mypy documentation`](http://mypy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is written very nicely and has a lot of code samples demonstrating/describing the functionality of their checker; it is definitely worth a read.\\n\\n\\n### Function annotations and special comments:\\n\\n\\nFirst, it\\'s interesting to observe some of the behavior we can get when using special comments. Special `# type: type` comments\\ncan be added during variable assignments to indicate the type of an object if one cannot be directly inferred. Simple assignments are\\ngenerally easily inferred but others, like lists (with regard to their contents), cannot.\\n\\n\\n**Note:** If we want to use any derivative of *containers* and need to specify the contents for that container we **must** use the ***generic*** types from the `typing` module. **These support indexing.**\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n# Generic List, supports indexing.\\nfrom typing import List\\n\\n# In this case, the type is easily inferred as type: int.\\ni = 0\\n\\n# Even though the type can be inferred as of type list\\n# there is no way to know the contents of this list.\\n# By using type: List[str] we indicate we want to use a list of strings.\\na = []  # type: List[str]\\n\\n# Appending an int to our list\\n# is statically not correct.\\na.append(i)\\n\\n# Appending a string is fine.\\na.append(\"i\")\\n\\nprint(a)  # [0, \\'i\\']\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf we add these commands to a file and execute them with our interpreter, everything works just fine and `print(a)` just prints\\nthe contents of list `a`. The `# type` comments have been discarded, *treated as plain comments which have no additional semantic meaning*.\\n\\n\\nBy running this with `mypy`, on the other hand, we get the following response:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n(Python3)jimmi@jim: mypy typeHintsCode.py\\ntypesInline.py:14: error: Argument 1 to \"append\" of \"list\" has incompatible type \"int\"; expected \"str\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nIndicating that a list of `str` objects cannot contain an `int`, which, statically speaking, is sound. This can be fixed by either abiding to the type of `a` and only appending `str` objects or by changing the type of the contents of `a` to indicate that any value is acceptable (Intuitively performed with `List[Any]` after `Any` has been imported from `typing`).\\n\\n\\nFunction annotations are added in the form `param_name : type` after each parameter in your function signature and a return type is specified using the `-> type` notation before the ending function colon; all annotations are stored in the `__annotations__` attribute for that function in a handy dictionary form. Using a trivial example (which doesn\\'t require extra types from the `typing` module):\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\ndef annotated(x: int, y: str) -> bool:\\n    return x < y\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe `annotated.__annotations__` attribute now has the following values:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n{\\'y\\': <class \\'str\\'>, \\'return\\': <class \\'bool\\'>, \\'x\\': <class \\'int\\'>}\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf we\\'re a complete newbie, or we are familiar with Python\\xa02.7 concepts and are consequently unaware of the `TypeError` lurking in the comparison of `annotated`, we can perform another static check, catch the error and save us some trouble:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n(Python3)jimmi@jim: mypy typeHintsCode.py\\ntypeFunction.py: note: In function \"annotated\":\\ntypeFunction.py:2: error: Unsupported operand types for > (\"str\" and \"int\")\\n\\n```\\n\\nAmong other things, calling the function with invalid arguments will also get caught:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\nannotated(20, 20)\\n\\n# mypy complains:\\ntypeHintsCode.py:4: error: Argument 2 to \"annotated\" has incompatible type \"int\"; expected \"str\"\\n\\n```\\n\\nThese can be extended to basically any use case and the errors caught extend further than basic calls and operations. The types you\\ncan check for are really flexible and I have merely given a small sneak peak of its potential. A look in the `typing` module, the\\nPEPs or the `mypy` documentation will give you a more comprehensive idea of the capabilities offered.\\n\\n\\n### Stub files:\\n\\n\\nStub files can be used in two different non mutually exclusive cases:\\n\\n\\n* You need to type check a module for which you do not want to directly alter the function signatures\\n* You want to write modules and have type-checking but additionally want to separate annotations from content.\\n\\n\\nWhat stub files (with an extension of `.pyi`) are is an annotated interface of the module you are making/want to use. They contain\\nthe signatures of the functions you want to type-check with the body of the functions discarded. To get a feel of this, given a set\\nof three random functions in a module named `randfunc.py`:\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\ndef message(s):\\n    print(s)\\n\\ndef alterContents(myIterable):\\n    return [i for i in myIterable if i % 2 == 0]\\n\\ndef combine(messageFunc, itFunc):\\n    messageFunc(\"Printing the Iterable\")\\n    a = alterContents(range(1, 20))\\n    return set(a)\\n\\n```\\n\\nWe can create a stub file `randfunc.pyi`, in which we can place some restrictions if we wish to do so. The downside is that\\nsomebody viewing the source without the stub won\\'t really get that annotation assistance when trying to understand what is supposed\\nto be passed where.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, the structure of a stub file is pretty simplistic: Add all function definitions with empty bodies (`pass` filled) and\\nsupply the annotations based on your requirements. Here, let\\'s assume we only want to work with `int` types for our Containers.\\n\\n\\n\\n```\\n# Stub for randfucn.py\\nfrom typing import Iterable, List, Set, Callable\\n\\ndef message(s: str) -> None: pass\\n\\ndef alterContents(myIterable: Iterable[int])-> List[int]: pass\\n\\ndef combine(\\n    messageFunc: Callable[[str], Any],\\n    itFunc: Callable[[Iterable[int]], List[int]]\\n)-> Set[int]: pass\\n\\n```\\n\\nThe `combine` function gives an indication of why you might want to use annotations in a different file, they some times clutter up\\nthe code and reduce readability (big no-no for Python). You could of course use type aliases but that sometime confuses more than it\\nhelps (so use them wisely).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nThis should get you familiarized with the basic concepts of type hints in Python. Even though the type checker used has been\\n`mypy` you should gradually start to see more of them pop-up, some internally in IDEs ([**PyCharm**](http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2015/11/python-3-5-type-hinting-in-pycharm-5/),) and others as standard Python modules.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll try and add additional checkers/related packages in the following list when and if I find them (or if suggested).\\n\\n\\n***Checkers I know of***:\\n\\n\\n* [**Mypy**](http://mypy-lang.org/): as described here.\\n* [**PyType**](https://github.com/google/pytype): By Google, uses different notation from what I gather, probably worth a look.\\n\\n\\n***Related Packages/Projects***:\\n\\n\\n* [**typeshed:**](https://github.com/python/typeshed/) Official Python repository housing an assortment of stub files for the standard library.\\n\\n\\nThe `typeshed` project is actually one of the best places you can look to see how type hinting might be used in a project of your own.

For the `Counter` class we can see that it can either take no arguments in its initializer, get a single `Mapping` from any type to an `int` *or* take an `Iterable` of any type.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n**Notice**: One thing I forgot to mention was that the `typing` module has been introduced on a *provisional basis*.

As a result they resort to trying to infer the type with (as mentioned in the presentation) around 50% success rate.\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Helps type checkers:** By hinting at what type you want the object to be the type checker can easily detect if, for instance, you're passing an object with a type that isn't expected.\n",
       "2. **Helps with documentation:** A third person viewing your code will know what is expected where, ergo, how to use it without getting them `TypeErrors`.\n",
       "3. **Helps IDEs develop more accurate and robust tools:** Development Environments will be better suited at suggesting appropriate methods when know what type your object is. You have probably experienced this with some IDE at some point, hitting the `.` and having methods/attributes pop up which aren't defined for an object.\n",

This is mainly written for anybody bumping into this question and wondering where to begin.\n",

       "annotations and proposing guidelines for **how** type checking can/should be performed. You can annotate your functions and\n",
       "hint as many things as you want; your scripts will still run regardless of the presence of annotations because Python itself doesn't use them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "* Function annotations ([PEP 3107](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/)).\n",
       "* Stub files for built-in/user modules.\n",
       "* Special  `# type: type` comments that complement the first two forms. (See: **[What are variable annotations?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39971929/what-are-variable-annotations-in-python-3-6/39973133#39973133)** for a Python 3.6 update for `# type: type` comments)\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, you'll want to use type hints in conjunction with the new [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module introduced in `Py3.5`. In it, many (additional) [ABCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)#Abstract_and_Concrete) (abstract base classes) are defined along with helper functions and decorators for use in static checking. Most ABCs in `collections.abc` are included, but in a *generic* form in order to allow subscription (by defining a `__getitem__()` method).\n",
