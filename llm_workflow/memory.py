"""
Memory refers to the information sent to a chat model (i.e. how much memory/context the model is
given). Within the context of an OpenAI model, it is the list of messages (a list of dictionaries
where the `role` is `system`, `assistant`, or `user`). Sending the entire list of messages means
the model uses the entire history as context for the answer. However, we can't keep sending the
entire history indefinitely, since we will exceed the maximum context length.

The classes defined below are used to create different strategies for managing memory. The
MemoryManager object is called by passing it a list of ExchangeRecord objects. It returns a list of
ExchangeRecord objects based on its internal logic for filtering/managing the messages/memory. Why
pass a list of ExchangeRecords rather than the underlying list of messages? Because the
ExchangeRecord should be a common interface across all models as opposed to lists that may differ
in structure depending on the model. This makes these objects interchangable if you swap out the
underlying model.

These classes can be used with, for example, the OpenAIChat model by passing a MemoryManager object
to the memory_manager variable when initializing the model object.
